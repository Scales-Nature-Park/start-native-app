- ~~need a way to export images and be able to have those images still inked to boservations (ie. naming them)~~
- add seperate fields for different photos (ex: plastron photo, injury photos, etc.) and snak would also be different (eg. dorsal photo)
- need to auto name photos 
- banner on photos? like a abanner at bottom with location and capture code data (and anthting else that is important)
- or watermark the images with important info so that images cna be uniquely modified.
- ~~have one person start an entry and then be able to transfer the rest of the entry to a different user or even just transfer coordinates~~
- ~~colour code entry between saved, quick-saved, as one is data validated and one is not~~ 
- ~~try to avoid colour blind colours~~
- ~~need to have a button to autofill the lat/long (maybe for others as well instead of it automatically doing it allow auto fill to be locked or activated), maybe also have a lat/long history for if the user took multiple coordinates~~
